# 20-Chore-7

20-Chore-7 is an application designed to allow users to efficiently manage and track their chores as well as those of their roomates. The application is designed to be intuitive to use and simple to navigate through the main features. 

## Running the App

Open main.html in a web browser of your choice to begin. 
To view what it would look like on a mobile device, switch to the responsive design view (Ctrl-shift-I then Ctrl-shift-M on Chrome or Ctrl-shift-M on Firefox).

## Task Descriptions

The three tasks are viewing your own chores, adding a chore assignment, and viewing the leaderboard. 

### Viewing Your Own Chores
The main screen is what the user will first see when they launch the application, which is essentially just a list of chores they still have to do and chores they have done. On the top side of the screen, there will be a swipe option to reveal icons to navigate to the chore assignment and the leaderboard. On the bottom, there will be a swipe option to reveal icons of the user’s roommates, showing a percentage ring around their icons indicating chore completion. For the user to successfully complete this task in design 1, they have to press the “back” button from any page other than the main screen. In design 2, they have to select themselves from the list of users on the main screen in order to see their schedule.

### Adding A Chore Assignment
The app will make the trouble of assigning chores a thing of the past using the assignment feature. For the user to successfully complete this task, they have to press the “add chore” button in the bottom right of the landing page, then specify of the chore is repeating or a one-time occurrence. Next, the user enters the details of the chore in the subsequent new Chore pages, where they chose the chore name, chore picture, assignees, and points value.

### Viewing The Leaderboard
The accountability of actually doing the assigned chores comes through with allowing users to monitor their roommates’ chores, providing positive stimulus to those who do their chores. The data for which roommates are doing their chores on time will be available on the leaderboard, where users can see which of their roommates is on track with their chores. For the user to successfully complete this task, they must navigate to the leaderboard page by pressing the leaderboard button located on the main page.
